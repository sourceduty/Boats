### Boat Notes

<details><summary>Boat Planing</summary>
<br>

![Planing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa7c150e-2d1d-4330-9dfd-bfb321d4651c)

A speedboat accelerates to a plane through a series of distinct stages, starting with initial acceleration. In this phase, the boat, which is in displacement mode, relies on its engine to generate thrust and propel it forward. As the boat gains speed, it enters the bow rise stage, where the front of the boat lifts out of the water due to the hydrodynamic lift generated by the forward motion. However, this lift also causes the stern to dig deeper, increasing drag temporarily. This transitional phase is crucial as the boat must overcome this increased drag to continue accelerating.

Once the speedboat reaches a critical speed, it transitions to planing. During this stage, the hydrodynamic lift becomes strong enough to raise most of the hull out of the water, significantly reducing the wetted surface area and drag. The boat then enters the planing mode, where it skims on top of the water, allowing for higher speeds with less engine power. Finally, in the stabilization stage, a balance is achieved between the hydrodynamic lift and the boat's weight, maintaining a stable plane. The operator can now adjust the throttle to control the speed, ensuring the boat stays above the planing threshold. This process demonstrates the intricate balance of forces required for a speedboat to achieve and maintain planing efficiently.

<br>

Planing Process:

```
Example: Calculating the critical speed for planing and acceleration in different modes

Given parameters
m = 1000  mass of the boat in kg
g = 9.81  acceleration due to gravity in m/s^2
rho = 1000  density of water in kg/m^3
A_L = 2.5  lift-generating area of the hull in m^2
C_L = 0.5  lift coefficient (assumed)
c_d = 0.1  drag coefficient in displacement mode (assumed)
c_d_prime = 0.05  drag coefficient in planing mode (assumed)
T = 5000  thrust generated by the engine in N

Calculate the critical speed for planing
v_crit = (2 * m * g / (rho * A_L * C_L)) ** 0.5
print(f"Critical speed for planing: {v_crit:.2f} m/s")

Initial acceleration phase (v < v_crit)
v = 0  initial velocity
D = c_d * v**2  initial drag force
a_initial = (T - D) / m
print(f"Initial acceleration: {a_initial:.2f} m/s^2")

Transition to planing (v = v_crit)
D_transition = c_d * v_crit**2
a_transition = (T - D_transition) / m
print(f"Acceleration at transition to planing: {a_transition:.2f} m/s^2")

Planing mode (v > v_crit)
v_planing = v_crit + 5  assume boat reaches a speed 5 m/s above critical speed
D_planing = c_d_prime * v_planing**2
a_planing = (T - D_planing) / m
print(f"Acceleration in planing mode: {a_planing:.2f} m/s^2")

Steady-state condition (T = D_planing)
No acceleration, speed is constant


Summary of Equations:

Initial Acceleration:
T - c_d * v^2 = m * dv/dt

Critical Speed for Planing:
v_crit = sqrt( (2 * m * g) / (rho * A_L * C_L) )

Planing Mode Drag:
D_planing = c_d' * v^2

Steady-State Condition:
T = D_planing
```

<details><summary>Boat Hull Stability</summary>
<br>

The most stable boat hull design depends on the intended use of the vessel, environmental conditions, and specific stability criteria, but generally, certain designs are renowned for their stability. One of the most stable hull designs is the catamaran, which features two parallel hulls. This design offers excellent stability because the wide beam (width) creates a lower center of gravity and reduces the rolling motion caused by waves. Catamarans are particularly popular for leisure and racing vessels due to their stability and ability to maintain higher speeds with less power.

Another highly stable design is the deep-V hull, commonly used in powerboats and fishing boats. The deep-V hull cuts through waves efficiently, providing a smoother ride in rough waters. This design is characterized by a steep angle at the bow, which helps to minimize impact with waves, enhancing stability. Deep-V hulls are favored for their ability to handle adverse weather conditions and rough seas, making them a preferred choice for offshore activities.

For slow-moving or stationary activities, such as fishing or leisure cruising, pontoon boats offer exceptional stability. Pontoons have a flat, buoyant design with two or more floatation tubes, providing a stable platform that resists tipping. This stability makes pontoon boats ideal for calm lakes and rivers, where they provide a comfortable and steady experience for passengers.

Monohull displacement boats, such as traditional sailboats and trawlers, also offer good stability, particularly when designed with a heavy keel. The keel acts as a counterbalance to the force of the wind on the sails, providing stability and preventing capsizing. These boats are designed to move efficiently through the water, offering a stable and steady ride, especially in long-distance cruising.

Each hull design has its advantages and is chosen based on the specific needs and conditions faced by the vessel. While catamarans and deep-V hulls are known for their stability in rough waters, pontoon boats excel in calm conditions, and monohull displacement boats provide a balanced approach suitable for various maritime activities.
